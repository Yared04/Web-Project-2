# GADA(ጋዳ) ETHIOPIA
The general idea of "GADA"which means gift is to create a web application where some users can post a specific issues related to funding and other users can lend a helping hand.
currently In our country this is done through ethio telecom using text messages like 8100. And our plan is to modernize this way by developing web application where every thing is direct and easy.


For this project we will have 3 type of users;
  1. Administrators
     - that have full previlages to all CRUD cpabilities towards all feature like adding/removing clients and posts 
     - control advertisements
     - will have managing page which includes authentication and authorization
  2. clients 
     - have privillages to CRUD posts
     - login into their accounts
     - have their own profiles and can manage it
  3. users
     - login(sign up if first time)
     - can only see the posts and provide fundings
     - will have their own profile pages and can manage it



**BUSINESS FEATURES**
1.
- posts,specific issues that needs funding 
- funding, where a user can provide funds
    - The funding will be done via bank transfer, 
2. 
  - chat or  comment between user giving the funding and the client that requires it

******************************************************
- We are planning to include an api integration for the next project, that is why we left the page after donating empty.
- In order to be an admin one has to manually change one's role in the database(user_roles table),because when registering everyone is given a user role automatically, only for the first time though.After that the admin can change the roles of other users.
